# Oracle-School-Project
This was my school's capstone project for the University of Colorado Colorado Springs. Teams of approximately 4 were assigned to address the needs of a client.
This project is a project management tool that was created to address the needs of a client from Oracle. Looking back on it I see a lot of alignment and other visual inconsistency issues, but I still look back on it fondly.

This is the biggest project I have worked on so far and was made in collaboration with my wonderful team members:
Benard Cheserem 
Mohammed Shaikh 
Nicholas Traczek
